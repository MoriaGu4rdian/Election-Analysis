## Election Audit Summary
This Python script is incredibly utilitarian, as it plows through tens of thousands of data points in seconds and could drastically speed up election result times and reduce manpower. This script could be altered for local elections to replace counties with voting precincts. Additionally, duplicating the same script for candidates in order to process policy initiatives can quickly count the number of individuals at a local or state level that support certain legislation.
